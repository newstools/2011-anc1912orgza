Comrades and Compatriots,Today the African National Congress is 99 years old and thus enters its 100th year of its existence.When we celebrate our centenary in Mangaung next year, we will be celebrating the triumph of a people united in struggle, when the masses of our people united with progressive forces across the world, to fight against an oppressive regime.As South Africans, Africans and humanity at large we celebrate this tremendous example of human solidarity.On this 99th anniversary of the ANC, we are proud to state boldly that whilst others may change their allegiances and their mission with the shifting sands of illusion, the ANC remains consistent. We adapt to and move with the times, but our mission remains the creation of a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous society.The ANC is the most consistent entity for transformation of our country. We have not back-tracked, we have worked to achieve the goals of the National Democratic Revolution, (NDR), which is to build a national democratic society.Our consistency saw us travel the path battling a violent past and achieving peace for our children in their lifetime. Now the children of our children must be given the right they own, to enjoy peace and to build our nation and achieve prosperity.This is the year for consolidating people`s power for the national democratic society as we move towards the 100 years of selfless people`s struggle.We must make the decisive shift to meaningful economic transformation and set in motion a very deliberate programme that will ensure that the benefits of our political liberation are shared amongst all our people.Our people have struggled selflessly for freedom from oppression. We cannot fail them when it comes to the struggle for the elimination of poverty.To this end the ANC will be in the forefront of engaging with every role player in this economy and marshal our forces towards the goal of achieving an eradication of poverty.This will include the deepening of empowerment of black South Africans in general. We have to live the promise of the Freedom Charter, which states amongst others, that all our people will share in the wealth of the country.Political emancipation without economic transformation is meaningless. That is why we have to commit ourselves to economic freedom in our lifetime, and the ANC must continue to be in the forefront of that transformation.ANNIVERSARIESOn this special occasion we take note of special anniversaries that will be marked this year.We will celebrate:Ninety-Five Years since the establishment of the historic and epoch making University of Fort Hare.Ninety Years since the formation of the Communist Party of South Africa; now the South African Communist Party.Eighty Years since the formation of the Bantu Women`s League, the forerunner of the ANC Women`s League, which leads us in the fight for the emancipation of women.Fifty Years since the establishment of the people`s army, uMkhonto we Sizwe.Fifty Years of the receiving of the Nobel Peace Prize by ANC President-General Chief Albert Luthuli.Thirty-Five years since the Soweto students uprising.Twenty Years since the United Democratic Front declared that its goals had been met and called on our people to build the ANC into a mighty force for justice, democracy and peace.Twenty Years since the first meeting of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, which was tasked with resolving centuries of political conflict in our country, and also with defining the transitional constitutional arrangement for a post-apartheid South Africa.SELFLESS AND CONSISTENT STRUGGLEThe ANC has an enormous responsibility as the leader of society and as the only organisation capable of uniting all the people of South Africa around a common vision.As described by our former President, Comrade Oliver Tambo, at the funeral of Comrade Moses Mabhida, the ANC is the “parliament of all the people of our country, the representative of our future (and) the negation of the divisions and conflicts that racial arrogance and capitalist greed have imposed on our people”.This movement will continue to promote these objectives of the National Democratic Revolution, (NDR) – to unite all South Africans behind the vision of a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa.On this 99th anniversary, we reaffirm the character of the ANC as a disciplined force of the left, a multi-class mass movement and an internationalist movement with an anti-imperialist outlook.We underscore that to achieve its strategic objectives, the ANC must vigorously adhere to the principles of unity, selfless service, collective leadership, democratic centralism, internal debates, humility, honesty, hard work, constructive criticism and self-criticism, discipline and mutual respect, as part of the traditions of the movement.These are the traditions that were reinforced at the National General Council meeting in September 2010.We draw attention to the NGC directive that for the ANC to remain strong and effective, discipline is a non-negotiable that must be enforced at all levels of membership and leadership, without fear or favour.We emphasise too, that the ANC remains unwavering in its commitment to the Alliance with the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions.The South African National Civics Organisation is our natural and close partner as the Tripartite Alliance, and forms a key part and component of our broad movement leadership collective.The Alliance has always been at the forefront of exercising people`s power and each component has a historic role and mission within the Alliance.The revolutionary trade union movement and the ANC continue to work together, with the ANC playing its historical role as the shield and the trade union movement as the spear, as pronounced by the President-General of the ANC, Chief Albert Luthuli.The two organisations plus the SACP must continue to act in unison to defend and advance the interests of workers and the poor.The SACP, the vanguard of the working class, has always provided robust and profound intellectual and ideological debate to the Alliance.The ANC as the leader of the Alliance, has the responsibility of providing revolutionary support to the Alliance components. The SACP and COSATU have a responsibility to strengthen and defend the ANC.These responsibilities must be executed within the established and time-tested culture and discipline of our movement.We must not allow ourselves to introduce new tendencies that are foreign to our movement, such as engaging one another in public on internal matters.BUILDING THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC SOCIETYThe ANC pursues the NDR, which as stated in the 2007 Strategy and Tactics strives to realise:a united state based on the will of all the people, without regard to race, sex, belief, language, ethnicity or geographic locationa dignified and improving quality of life among all the people by providing equal rights and opportunities to all citizens, andthe restoration of the birthright of all South Africans regarding access to land and other resources.This is the ideal society the ANC strives to put in place. The ANC has succeeded very well in putting in place a united state based on the will of the people and we are largely succeeding with promoting non-racialism and non-sexism.However, we know that we have not succeeded as we should have in the economic liberation and advancement of the majority of South Africans. That is why the ANC is adamant that we will pursue this aspect of the NDR with more vigour and dedicated attention in this phase.The ANC is convinced that central to building a more just and a more equal society is the creation of more and sustainable decent jobs and opportunities for self-employment across all rungs of the socio-economic ladder.A MORE PROSPEROUS SOUTH AFRICAa. Creating decent workLargely through the efforts of the ANC, our society has become more prosperous. There has been considerable growth in the middle class and especially, the black middle class, which numbered 2.6 million in 2007.However, this prosperity has tended to replicate and intensify apartheid fault lines with notable exceptions. The people most affected by deepening and widening poverty and inequality have been black South Africans and most notably black rural women and young people.The ANC is therefore committed to addressing the problem of unemployment through practical measures in this year. Therefore, 2011 will be the year of job creation through meaningful economic transformation.It is not enough to say that more and equitable sharing of economic growth will lead to the creation of jobs. We know that South Africa experienced relatively strong economic growth during the 2000s, but we also know that this growth did not address the structural challenges in the economy.We still have unacceptably high levels of poverty and inequality. We have a crisis of high unemployment in our country. It is only by enabling our people to free themselves from poverty, by providing decent and sustainable jobs and opportunities to become entrepreneurs that we will really bring about a better life for all.The ANC said in 2007 that the creation of jobs must be the central focus of our economic policies and this was translated into one of our manifesto priorities in 2009. As a result of this, we have put in place a New Growth Path that will:Identify areas where employment creation is possible on a large scale as a result of substantial changes in conditions in South Africa and globallyDevelop a policy package to facilitate employment creation in these areas, through: A comprehensive drive to enhance both social equity and competitiveness.Systemic changes to mobilise domestic investment around activities that can create sustainable employment, andStrong social dialogue to focus all stakeholders on encouraging growth in employment-creating activities.Changes in technology and actions taken to mitigate against the impact of climate change have opened up opportunities to create jobs on a large scale. As the ANC has been saying consistently, the global economic crisis has opened up space for a fundamental transformation of the world economy and we must use this space to advance a more equitable global economic order.Research has shown that our economy can create jobs in sectors such as infrastructure development, mining, agriculture, tourism, green and knowledge-based sectors, rural development, infrastructure development projects on the continent, the services sector as well as the social economy and the public sector.South Africa has already shown that we are capable of successfully driving massive infrastructure projects in preparing for the 2010 World Cup and we will now build on that experience to drive further projects in housing and other social areas.We will also make sure that these projects lead to more inclusive growth by meeting the needs of new industries and historically excluded communities. The ANC-led government will make sure that public procurement is used to support the domestic manufacturing sector, which should lead to more jobs being created in this sector.The social economy can create many jobs through co-operatives, burial societies, stokvels and community trusts. These institutions can also contribute to social cohesion and trust. ANC branches must be integral parts of such community initiatives.We must also continue exploring ways of further unlocking the country`s mining sector potential and to align the sector firmly with our economic transformation and development goals.We will explore public sector employment in the areas of health, education, policing, social services and community and public works programmes to improve service delivery and the quality of life.All government departments will be required to put the appropriate programmes in place and establish the right environment for the creation of many decent and sustainable jobs in every way possible.The role of state-owned enterprises and the development finance institutions will also be crucial to achieve the New Growth Path goals. The institutions will need to operate differently and more effectively.We will not be able to achieve our goals only through the State. We must unite our people behind the bold vision on jobs and draw on the collective energies of all South Africans to achieve that vision.We need a social partnership between government, business and labour in which we all commit to doing what is required to achieve these objectives.Such a pact must ensure that the benefits and sacrifices of the New Growth Path are shared equitably, and that no one social partner is asked to bear disproportionate responsibility for this.b. HealthThe ANC will continue to implement the 10 Point Plan on health.We will work tirelessly to create a health system that promotes women`s health as a fundamental human right. We will promote the provision of sanitary towels to women on the indigent list of municipalities.Accelerated work must be undertaken to further revitalise and improve our public health care system and to attend to the intense pressure and challenges facing health services in some provinces. Interventions must include appointing qualified personnel and improving infrastructure such as rebuilding dilapidated clinics and hospitals.The ANC must also ensure that government increases the training and employment of doctors, nurses, health technicians and other health professionals.We must fast-track the implementation of the National Health Insurance scheme. The development of timeframes for implementation is the crucial first step in this process.We have made substantial progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS given our renewed focus on the campaign.We continue to urge our people to know their HIV status and thereby empower themselves and government to offer targeted responses to this disease.c. EducationWe will continue implementing the decisions of the 52nd National Conference, the 10 Point Plan as well as the 2009 Election Manifesto.The outstanding improvement in the 2010 national senior certificate results proves that we are on the right track. The ANC congratulates the 2010 matric students on their outstanding achievements.We continue to promote our non-negotiables in education which includes that teachers must be in school, in class, on time, teaching for at least seven hours a day.We will continue to engage with communities, school governing bodies as well as education sector trade unions about these important goals.Government must provide textbooks and all materials on the first day of school and provide the necessary support.Government must improve the infrastructure; including attending to the more than 3000 schools that need to be brought up to basic safety functionality levels by 2014.The programme of building new schools to replace mud schools must continue and must form part of the Infrastructure and Expanded Public Works programmes.The ANC government will continue to widen access to tertiary and further education for the poor and working class.We have to prioritise further education and training and provide resources including expanding bursary schemes for supporting attendance at FET institutions.In line with the vision of the Freedom Charter, and the resolution of our 52nd National Conference, we are committed to progressively introduce free education up to undergraduate level.With effect from this year, 2011, students who are registered at a public university in their final year of study and who qualify for funding from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, will receive a loan equivalent to the full cost of study, which is the full fee and the necessary living expenses.If these students graduate at the end of the year, the loan for the final year will be converted to a full bursary. They will not have to repay the amount.This model will be phased in over the next few years to include students in earlier years of study. Also from 2011, students in Further Education and Training Colleges who qualify for financial aid will be exempted completely from paying fees. The ANC will also work harder to promote the role of State Owned Enterprises in the training of artisans to promote skills development.d. Peace and StabilityThe ANC government will continue to invest in making our people to be secure and feel safe.We commend our police service for the significant decline in the murder rate and other serious crimes, which indicates the successes of the increased focus on the fight against crime.Progress is being made in increasing the capacity of the police through recruitment, rigorous training, improving the detective services, forensics, prosecution, judicial services and crime intelligence.In the interest of national security, we must speed up the regulation of the private security industry, which often possesses and has access to more dangerous weaponry than necessary.The ANC remains steadfast in opposition to corruption. The ANC NEC has started the process of developing guidelines for the ANC Integrity Committee.The ANC government has a number of structures whose task is to prevent, fight and deal with corruption, including a Cabinet Inter-Ministerial Committee, the Special Investigating Unit and an Anti-Corruption Task Team led by the Hawks.Various investigations are currently underway in the public service, designed to help us ensure clean governance.e. Rural Development and Land ReformThe restoration of the land to the people has always been an integral part of the struggle for freedom.Land reform will now be based on the de-racialisation of the rural economy. This will enable shared and sustained growth as well as democratic and equitable land allocation and use across gender, race and class. Also needed is a strict production discipline for guaranteed national food security.In order to have more land available for land reform and restitution, government is looking at three forms of land holding. These are that state land that can only be held through leasehold; freehold with limited extent on private land and foreigners will be allowed to lease land but ownership will revert to South Africans.The ANC government will enact legislation that will give greater protection to farm workers and farm dwellers. We will also improve our capacity to monitor and enforce compliance with this legislation.f. Social TransformationThe promotion of unity and social cohesion continues to be a key goal of the ANC and its government.The 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup demonstrated how all South Africans can unite across race, class and gender divides in a common celebration as a South African people.This first ever Soccer World Cup tournament on African soil unleashed overwhelming patriotism. The country`s rainbow flag and the Bafana Bafana jersey became the most popular items amongst South Africans.The world will always remember the powerful images of the entire country clad in national colours on 11 June 2010, rooting for the national team while welcoming the world with open arms.Building on the World Cup success, the ANC must unite all South Africans around a common vision of a non-racial society, built on the values of equality and respect for a common humanity. As part of the legacy of the World Cup and informed by Polokwance conference resolutions, we have to start integrating sport and physical education in the school curriculum, to build winning national teams of the future.The provision of sport and recreational facilities in poor and rural communities must also receive priority. The ANC will fully support the Rugby and Cricket teams during the respective World Cup tournaments this year. The ANC will continue playing a leading role in bringing about the full emancipation of women.We recognise the tremendous strides made since 1994, as evidenced by the role that women now play in the state, the economy and other sectors. We have made the establishment of habitable human settlements an important part of social transformation and progress is being made.In 2009 we provided more than 200 000 housing opportunities.ANC branches should assist in eradicating the problem of people who receive new houses, then rent them out and move back to informal settlements, causing government to chase moving targets. This irresponsible practice has to stop.A lot of progress has been made in providing water supply. More than 46 million South Africans or 93% of the population now has access to basic water supply.More than 400 000 additional people were served with basic water supply last year. By March this year, a further more than 800 000 South Africans will have been served with basic water supply.The ANC government electrifies more than 150 000 houses per year. Work continues as well to build energy security for the country.These endeavours, beyond providing shelter, contribute to economic growth and job creation – whilst at the same time restoring human dignity.South Africa has been relatively successful in the fight against poverty due to the extensive coverage of our social security programme.Close to 15 million South Africans obtain social grants from the State, 10 million of whom are children who receive the Child Support Grant, linked to school attendance.Since we are building a developmental and not a welfare state, the social grants should be linked to economic activity and community development, to enable short-term beneficiaries to become self-supporting in the long run.Alcohol and drug abuse are twin scourges that impact negatively on all aspects of South African society. Government has established an inter-Ministerial Committee to develop and implement a campaign to reduce the impact of alcohol abuse and drug use.The campaign will have a particular focus on alcohol given the high levels of abuse.The country needs a strong and diverse media that is independent of commercial and political interests, which will support nation building as well as efforts to deepen, consolidate and strengthen our democracy, social cohesion and good governance.We will continue encouraging the print media in particular, to speed up its transformation processes, in line with the attainment of freedom and democracy in the country in 1994.The ANC will continue to promote and fight for media freedom as it has always done throughout its existence.We reiterate what we said in our 2007 Strategy and Tactics document that we place a high premium on the involvement of our cadres in all centres of power.ANC cadres have a responsibility to promote progressive traditions within the intellectual community, which includes our universities and the media.We also need their presence and involvement in key strategic positions in the State as well as the private sector, and will continue strategic deployments in this regard.g. Local GovernmentThis year, our people will return to the polls to choose local government representatives of their choice. We have conducted substantial research and have spoken to our people. We are ready to institute effective improvements in this sphere that is closest to the people.We have something to build on. There are many aspects of local government that work very well in our country. In addition, the majority of our councillors serve our people with honesty and integrity. The ANC commends these diligent and true servants of the people.We also congratulate and acknowledge many municipalities that are fully functional and where ANC cadres and officials are doing their best to improve service delivery.We also congratulate host municipalities for outstanding service provision during the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup.However, we acknowledge that there are problems in certain municipalities which are being attended to.There are also a few councillors in some areas, who are, for various reasons, not performing their tasks in an acceptable manner. We have removed many such councillors from office already in some areas.We will continue to address this issue, and ensure that we deploy cadres who are ready and willing to provide the diligent selfless service that the ANC stands for.As part of the solution, our communities want to be integrally involved in choosing their local councillors. In this regard, the ANC will put in place a system that allows greater community participation in choosing candidates for the 2011 local government elections.Strong ANC and Alliance structures must be at the forefront of empowering communities to exercise peoples` power in this manner.We are also still convinced that senior municipal officials should not hold executive leadership positions in political parties.We will be vigilant in ensuring that ANC structures abide by this principle, while looking at other mechanisms to address the challenge.We do not have much time left before the elections. Therefore, ANC structures should work harder to prepare the ground for the ANC to win back all councils we control currently, and make sweeping advances in those that we still have to win.The election campaign must contribute to the Imvuselelo campaign and to building the mass base of the ANC.At the end of the elections we must be left with stronger structures, more accountable and responsive councillors, as well as branches that are in touch with their communities and able to drive transformation and development.h. Building a better Africa and a Better WorldThe ANC has always cherished the unity of the African continent and the African peoples.Almost all founding Presidents of the ANC spoke passionately about the unity of the African continent, including John Langalibalele Dube, Pixley Ka Isaka Seme, Sefako Mapogo Makgatho, Chief Albert Luthuli and others.The trend has continued throughout the 99 years of the existence of the ANC. We are immensely proud of the fact that throughout the century of its existence the ANC has occupied the front trenches with progressive forces in our continent who have carried the torch of progressive Pan-Africanism.We remain fully committed to the African agenda, including the strengthening of the African Union and the promotion of democracy, peace and stability in Africa.The ANC is also fully supportive of the New Partnership for Africa`s Development (NEPAD), and backs the ANC government`s new role of championing the African North-South infrastructure development corridor, focusing on road and rail networks.The ANC has strong party-to-party relations with former liberation movements in the SADC region and other parts of the continent.We will continue to enhance these relations in order to contribute towards deepening progressive political thought in the continent and globally.The ANC will continue to strengthen South-to-South cooperation, both politically and economically, through platforms such as India-Brazil-South Africa grouping and the China-Africa forum.We also look forward to boosting political and economic cooperation between ourselves and other emerging markets through the Brazil-Russia-India-China (BRIC) forum, which South Africa is pleased to have been invited to join.These relationships must take place on the basis of mutual benefit and development.We cannot afford to de-industrialise and become simply a provider of raw materials to other nations. Instead we must build a strong and diversified regional economy with a modern manufacturing base.The ANC government will continue to participate in forums such as the G20, the World Trade Organisation and others through its government, as part of the progressive forces that work to transform the global order into a more humane and equitable one.We look forward to successfully hosting the 17th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change in December in Durban this year.World nations will meet to build consensus on a sustainable model of development that will leave a world worth living in, to future generations.We take this opportunity to thank Africa as well as countries in other regions that supported our candidature for the non-permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council, which we resumed on the 1st of January.We will continue to support human rights, freedom, justice and democracy in the continent and the world, influenced by our track record and history. The ANC produced a Bill of Rights as early as 1943, even before the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights in 1948.We will continue to support the self-determination efforts of Western Sahara under the progressive leadership of Polisario, to ensure the liberation of the last colony in Africa.We wish the people of Sudan well during the referendum and will support them in all efforts of finding lasting solutions to their challenges.We are concerned about the developments in Cote d` Ivoire following the recent elections. A political solution needs to be found as soon as possible. We praise the efforts of ECOWAS and the African Union in searching for a solution. The gravity of the matter requires the participation of all of us, working with the ECOWAS and the African Union, in the interests of peace and stability in the continent.The ANC also supports Cuba in its campaign to end the economic blockade, and also reiterate the call for the immediate and unconditional release of the Cuban Five. The ANC has long called for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestine question and supports the two-state solution.The ANC congratulates the youth of South Africa for hosting the successful World Festival of the Youth and Students. The youth have made the ANC proud in the assurance that a new world order of peace and solidarity is possible.The ANC will continuously guide its government in the implementation of these local and international programmes, to ensure the fulfilment of the mandate obtained in the 2009 elections and the Polokwane conference resolutions.TASKS OF THE MOVEMENTAs we head towards the centenary next year, the membership of the African National Congress must carry out the following primary tasks in 2011:a. Leadership to SocietyAll members must work to build a strong and unified ANC that has the ability to give inspirational and moral leadership to the masses of our people and a broad range of social forces. This is a prerequisite for the achievement of the national democratic society.b. Organisational RenewalOur branches are the engine room and lifeblood of the organisation. Regional, provincial and national leadership structures should deploy resources to strengthen and empower branches to lead communities effectively.As directed by the NGC, every branch should have a standing monthly political development programme and a set of campaigns that speak to issues affecting their communities directly. We must intensify the imvuselelo campaign and ensure that we meet our target of one million members by 8 January 2012.Dedicated and consistent programmes of political education must support the drive for organisational renewal and recruitment. This is our collective responsibility as the membership of the ANC.c. The Unity of the movementNothing should divert the ANC from its historic mission and the strategic objectives of the NDR.The ANC Veterans League, Women`s League and Youth League must build and strengthen the ANC. Unity and discipline must be the thread that binds all components and structures of the movement.The ANC Women`s League should intensify its programmes of organising women in every corner of our country – in the churches, factories, farms, townships, villages and suburbs, attending to issues that affect their lives.The Veterans League should locate all veterans of our movement and actively bring them back into the ANC fold. Veterans should play a key role in political education in our branches.The ANC Youth League, historically the breeding ground for the future leadership of our movement, should provide political leadership and guidance to the youth and help us to make the ANC the natural political home of South African youth.The 2009 general election demonstrated that this is possible given the response of the youth to the innovative mobilisation work of the ANC Youth League.The Youth League also continues to make youth development a pivotal part of the ANC programme of action.d. Mobilisation towards the Centenary of the ANCOn this day next year, the ANC will bring together Africa and the world to celebrate a centenary of our people`s struggle against colonialism, racism and apartheid oppression.We will also be celebrating the solidarity we received from the Anti-Apartheid Movement and the progressive forces and freedom loving people from all over the world, in what was arguably the biggest global exercise of peoples` power the world has ever seen.ANC branches must use centenary build-up programmes as an opportunity to mobilise communities behind the ANC through membership drives, political education as well as consistent and effective campaigning.e. Promoting EqualityIt is the collective responsibility of the whole movement to work towards a society that is non-racial, non-sexist and united. All components and structures of the movement should actively develop campaigns and programmes to create such a society.f. Governance mandateFulfilling our governance mandate is a two-fold responsibility. There are comrades that are directly charged with serving our people through their duties as public servants or public representatives.This is a privilege and an opportunity to live the ANC creed of selfless service. The ANC continues to salute those comrades who do their jobs with distinction, dedication and commitment.The other part of this responsibility falls on ANC cadres, who through their branches and other ANC structures must assist in the monitoring and evaluation of our public servants and representatives. This should be done consistently and without fear or favour.The establishment of a dedicated monitoring and evaluation unit in the ANC head office will mainstream this function within the organisation.Working together as all components, we must do more to ensure the fulfilment of all these and other organisational tasks.ACHIEVEMENT AWARDSThe ANC Annual Achievement Awards were initiated to promote a greater focus on the organisational tasks of building branches, strengthening local government and building the leagues.The awards aim to highlight the features of strong branches and councils and to reward best practice within the movement. The awards are named for outstanding cadres of the ANC, whose individual qualities of commitment and selflessness are an example to every ANC member. During their lives, each of these people made an immeasurable contribution to the struggle for freedom and a better life for all.We are pleased to announce the winners of the ANC Achievement Awards for 2010:The Sol Plaatje Award, conferred on the best performing ANC branch, goes to the Alfred Nzo Branch, Free State.The Charlotte Maxeke Award, conferred on the best performing ANC Women`s League branch, goes to the Rosedale branch, Northern Cape.The Anton Lembede Award, conferred on the best performing ANC Youth League branch, goes to the Centurion branch, Gauteng.The ZK Matthews Award, conferred on the best performing group of ANC councillors goes to the ANC councillors of the John Taolo Gaetsewe District Municipality, Northern Cape.We congratulate the winners and runners-up on their hard work and commitment, and trust that they will continue to be the best examples of ANC structures.OBITUARIESWe salute our comrades, who have passed on during the past year.
